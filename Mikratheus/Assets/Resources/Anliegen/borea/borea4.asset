  message: 'Eyy what up Mate! Hope everything is cool with you. I''m about to throw
    the biggest party Borea has ever seen! You know, breathing in some good winds
    can make you feel especially many colors. Here''s the problem: we can''t get
    to them winds ourselves. It''d be cool if you could get us some of the good stuff
    - would be your ticket to the party!'
  question: Help them fly high in the sky?
