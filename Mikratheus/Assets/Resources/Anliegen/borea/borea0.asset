  message: 'So these are the times. It is dark here: The eastern winds are in rebellion,
    no, pure opposition - open war: Though brothers and sisters in nature, we do
    not fly in the same air any more. They are raging against us: Destroy palaces
    of clouds, gathering stormy lightnings, swallowing our children. My hope has
    wandered to you, Mihinaal, who we long dismissed.'
  question: Do you help the winds of Borea to be united again under a peaceful sky?
