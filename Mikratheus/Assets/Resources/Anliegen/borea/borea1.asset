  message: Hiii I am Wendy, but my friends call me Windy Wendy. For quite some time now, I am not able to fly as high as I want to. It is probably because I cheated on ONE game of hide and seek. The others took away some of my Windy powers, so now I am just Wendy. Please if there is somebody.. help me and I tell all my friends about it and we can ALL become friends! Thank you so much for your help god above the clouds :3.
  question: Do I care about a little girls problem?
