  message: 'We are a community of excellent Woodmasters and we have a problem. It
    seems, every one of us is affected by a so-called ''depression''. Neither we
    nor our doctor nor our priest nor our superior master is able to explain this,
    therefore, we ask you for an explanation and a solution. To allow you to make
    an informed analysis and decision, we provide you with all informations available
    to us: a) We are ensuring a healthy growth of our local trees. b) We plant them,
    raise them, fell them. c) The felled trees are sent into the smithies for burning.
    d) We never see our trees again. We would appreciate an answer.'
  question: Do I play the therapist for those Woodmasters?
  sender: 'From:  Society of Woodmasters, Loc. Underhill'
  subject: 'Subject: We do not know.'
