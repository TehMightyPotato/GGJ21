  message: "Here is High Priest Preswirk. We dug a hole into the planet and now the
    oceans are dwindling. We managed alright for some centuries now since you last
    helped us, but not we got said problem. Our miners dug too deep into the world\u2019s
    wall and when the deciding stones were broken, a great many more stones broke
    away, revealing an underground lake being fed by an underground river that originated
    in an ocean, as it seems. The situation is growing worse and the elder council
    finally decided that it is time to ask you for your help. We appreciate your
    existence."
  question: Help them fix their planet hole?
