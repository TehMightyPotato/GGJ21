  message: "First of all, I am thankful for the solid workplace and the good beer
    at closing time. But why Bass always drinks too much, that I do not know. Also,
    the community\u2019s steady decline has not stopped today, I think: Today, too,
    they were louder and ruder than in my youth. I ponder the thought of closing
    my tavern and moving on. A traveller played annoying songs tonight. The beer
    was good as ever. Sometimes I wish for simple answers from a higher power. Amen"
  question: Encourage the dwarf to close his tavern?
