  message: "First of all, I am thankful for the solid workplace and the good beer at closing time. But why Bass always drinks too much, that I do not know. Also, the communityâ€™s steady decline has not stopped today, I think: Today, too, they were louder and ruder than in my youth. I ponder the thought of closing my tavern and moving on. A traveller played annoying songs tonight. The beer was good as ever. Sometimes I wish for simple answers from a higher power. Amen"
