Why thy wind is blowing

Why is the ever lasting movement there

Why are we never un-wind-ing?

SUBJECT: Make me fly as high as the other winds

TIME: ..



DESCRIPTION

Hiii I am Wendy, but my friends call me Windy Wendy. For quite some time now, I am not able to fly as high as I want to. It is probably because I cheated on ONE game of hide and seek. The others took away some of my Windy powers, so now I am just Wendy. Please if there is somebody.. help me and I tell all my friends about it and we can ALL become friends! Thank you so much for your help god above the clouds :3.



QUESTION

Do I care about a little girls problem?



YES

I care about you Wendy! I will help you become Windy Wendy again and to fly as high as you want!

DESCRIPTION

My king told me of his missing son. He has a bright mind: I do not think he'll be forever lost. The sky is clearing up, as I speak - the weather-winds are on their way.

I thank you, my lord, for giving us speed and clear sight.



QUESTION

Will you contribute to the clearing of the skies?



YES

I like him. Being nice to me should be rewarded!

DESCRIPTION

By the winds, where has my youngest, the Jetstream, gone again? Playing tag with his siblings, he must have flown out of orbit.... I would mobilise my whole wind armies to get him back.



QUESTION

Bring young Jetstream back home safely?



YES

You're missed at home, little jet stream. We wouldn't want your dad to start a war.

The wind made its choice, perhaps it was fate that it is now somewhere else?

DESCRIPTION

Eyy what up Mate! Hope everything is cool with you. I'm about to throw the biggest party Borea has ever seen! You know, breathing in some good winds can make you feel especially many colors. Here's the problem: we can't get to them winds ourselves. It'd be cool if you could get us some of the good stuff - would be your ticket to the party!



QUESTION

Help them fly high in the sky?



YES

Hell yeah, haven't been to a good party in ages!

SUBJECT: Hope in dark times

TIME: ..



DESCRIPTION

So these are the times.

It is dark here: The eastern winds are in rebellion, no, pure opposition - open war: Though brothers and sisters in nature, we do not fly in the same air any more. They are raging against us: Destroy palaces of clouds, gathering stormy lightnings, swallowing our children. My hope has wandered to you, Mihinaal, who we long dismissed.



QUESTION

Do you help the winds of Borea to be united again under a peaceful sky?



YES

Let the storm calm down.
