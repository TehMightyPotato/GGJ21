  message: HELLO YOU! I AM KRUSKUS, A TROLL FROM KONETOS. Oh... maybe I shouldn't
    shout so much, Mama always told me to be a little quieter. Anyway... King Khorin
    send me on an important quest to search for stones. BIG IMPORTANT STONES for
    his crown. He sometimes need new ones. I need to bring them to him... but I don't
    know the way... and how dangerous this is... I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THEY LOOK
    LIKE! I am afraid to get lost in the mines ... Mom drew me a map but I can not
    read maps ...
  question: Show poor Kruskus the way?
