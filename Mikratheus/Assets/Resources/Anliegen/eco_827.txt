DESCRIPTION

Dear Ma’am or Mister,

We have a serious concern that the owl association is planning a coup against our ruler, the night queen. Therefore, we kindly ask for your help - we can not involve anyone else into this matter and are thus dependent on your grace.

Sincerely,

The Racoon Administration Group



QUESTION

Do you give the racoons a key hint to support their activities?

I don’t like grey eminences. Unveil the conspiracy!

There will always be evil in the world, fighting symptoms accomplishes nothing.

DESCRIPTION



Oh please, please can someone hear my woes?

I’m in love, but it must not be, can’t you see?

Where shall my sorrows lead?

Shall I end in - ever lasting, lonely darkness?

Why can’t the one, whom I see yet cannot grasp, be here with me?

Ah! Were I a fox down on the earth - happy ever after



QUESTION

Lead the two lovers to each other?



YES

Let there be love!

DESCRIPTION

We, the kings of the air and rightful heirs of Tron claim our birthright! Only in the shadow of the lunar eclipse we can do it - but we cannot pull off the coup without your help! For the stars must be favorable to defeat the superiority of the enemy. Give us the power that was always ours and it will not be to your disadvantage....



QUESTION

Should I chance the stars in their favor?



YES

It is their birth right, and it benefits me.

SUBJECT: Silver lining / A bright light appeared

TIME: ..



DESCRIPTION



Never in my life were matters so urgent, and here I am now, praying to a god that birds, fish and all walking creatures have long neglected - or forgotten. Forgive me. My world is dark, there never has been any light brighter than a crystal in its cave or a silent moon wandering the sky. But now, a new moon has risen: Bright it is, piercing in our eyes, burning our flesh, rotting our food. Help us, oh master of the world! Forgive us for our long silence!



QUESTION

Do you ban the bright source and save the Nightqueen’s folk?



YES

I've always been a fan of moonlight and melancholy thoughts.

DESCRIPTION



I am roaming, drifting about, as an eagle does. And what do I do? It is here, carried by the winds, that I realize: It is for the pleasure of hunting that I’m rising in the air day after day, moon after moon. Is it not strange that I cannot even enjoy the wide richness of the world? All I do is rising and falling, falling down to the earth, to take a small creature’s life. What worth is in such deeds? Why do I exist, if I cannot choose to do else?



QUESTION

Do you grant the eagle freedom from his burden?



YES

Lift the shackles of instinct from this poor creature.
