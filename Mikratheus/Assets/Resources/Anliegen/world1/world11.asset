  message: Good day other higher form of life - in case you exist. We have encounterd
    a phenomenon that we currently can not explain. On the surface of World 1, formerly
    'Earth', we have come across strange protective suits tht seem to make no sense.
    Analysis has shown that they do not even protect against dangerous radiation,
    only against UV radiation, which has become irellevsnt to our life form. However,
    we have to admit that these suits look fancier than ours - I wonder if it would
    be safe to keep them with us?
  question: Explain them what 'Fashion' actually is?
