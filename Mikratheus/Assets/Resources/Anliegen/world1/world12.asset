  message: "In my latest studies I found plans from the early stage of humans, who planed a trip to the moon. An interesting idea - the moon was never our priority, because we were focused on the problems of World 1. Now that we fixed most of it, I think a journey to the moon is possible. My calculations are not finished yet and the other AI's I talked to called me a mad robot. So I am kind of dependent on some godly help."
  question: "Do I help an AI accomplish a trip to the moon?"
