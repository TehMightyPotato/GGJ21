  message: We, the kings of the air and rightful heirs of Tron claim our birthright!
    Only in the shadow of the lunar eclipse we can do it - but we cannot pull off
    the coup without your help! For the stars must be favorable to defeat the superiority
    of the enemy. Give us the power that was always ours and it will not be to your
    disadvantage....
  question: Should I chance the stars in their favor?
