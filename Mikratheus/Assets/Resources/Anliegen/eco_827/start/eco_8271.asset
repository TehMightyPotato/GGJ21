  message: "Never in my life were matters so urgent, and here I am now, praying to a god that birds, fish and all walking creatures have long neglected - or forgotten. Forgive me. My world is dark, there never has been any light brighter than a crystal in its cave or a silent moon wandering the sky. But now, a new moon has risen: Bright it is, piercing in our eyes, burning our flesh, rotting our food. Help us, oh master of the world! Forgive us for our long silence!"
  question: "Do you ban the bright source and save the Nightqueenâ€™s folk?"
  sender: "From:  Her Highness the Nightqueen"
  subject: "Subject: Silver lining / A bright light appeared"
