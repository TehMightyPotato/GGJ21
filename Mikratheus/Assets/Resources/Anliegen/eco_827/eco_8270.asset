  message: "I am roaming, drifting about, as an eagle does. And what do I do? It
    is here, carried by the winds, that I realize: It is for the pleasure of hunting
    that I\u2019m rising in the air day after day, moon after moon. Is it not strange
    that I cannot even enjoy the wide richness of the world? All I do is rising and
    falling, falling down to the earth, to take a small creature\u2019s life. What
    worth is in such deeds? Why do I exist, if I cannot choose to do else?"
  question: Do you grant the eagle freedom from his burden?
